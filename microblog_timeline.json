Today’s one reminded me that 40 years ago, the Challenger space shuttle accident happened https://www.  https://  history.com/this-day-in-histor  y/january-28/challenger-explodes   .  I was a junior in high school and remember hearing about it over the loudspeaker. So many people were really sad that day. It feels like yesterday, but also a long time ago.  # Challenger    # SpaceShuttle    # ThisDayInHistory",
