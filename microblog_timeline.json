The PLC revert worked and API calls succeed, but the official apps still show a JWT error when loading content. Bluesky support has gone silent for over two weeks. I've escalated to the PDS operators Discord. If you follow me on Bluesky, I can't see or respond to anything there right now.   # Bluesky    # PDS    # SelfHosting    # ATProto",
