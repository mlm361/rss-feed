&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Embark on a thrilling journey with the Fantastic Four as they harness their newfound powers to save the world in their first epic adventure!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; ⭐⭐⭐½ (3.5/5 stars)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the movie was decent. The storyline and the cast were quite good. What I found less convincing was the attempt to merge the 1930s-1960s era with advanced technology and space travel. This combination didn't come across as believable. If retro-futurism was a deliberate choice for the society depicted in the film, it needed more explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
