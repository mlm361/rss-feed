&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the desolate wasteland of New Vegas, three survivors and their loyal dog embark on a perilous journey through a post-apocalyptic world where every step could be their last.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 stars)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episodes:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 | &lt;strong&gt;Aired:&lt;/strong&gt; 12-16-2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season answered a lot of questions and introduced a few new ones. But I actually liked this season better than the first season. I think they did the flashbacks much better this season, and this is thoroughly engaging and enjoyable entertainment. The one negative I would have is that this is not the first TV show or movie that has tried to technologize the 50s after World War 2 and the 60s. I am always astonished at the technology they built but other things that seem like simpler items that they miss, and I say why doesn't the technology they have built work here or there. Oh, and I didn't miss the few references to modern day issues and Trump. I find it amazing how politics of today is meshing into TV shows. Some do it well (like here) and some don't (like the recent Superman of 2025). But one thing on the real life side is the old axiom, history seems to always repeat itself. 
Looking forward to Season 3.&lt;/p&gt;
