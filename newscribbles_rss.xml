      <description xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">&lt;p&gt;Great news today at my follow-up with my hypertrophic cardiomyopathy specialist. Camzyos is really starting to work. My most recent echo earlier this week was excellent, and so was the heart cath I had in late December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the heart cath showed that Camzyos is working well enough that I do not need to rush into an alcohol ablation or a septal myectomy. If I ever do need an intervention in the future, my doctor said I would be a good candidate for septal alcohol ablation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also told my doctor that, if at all possible, I would prefer to stay on medication and avoid any surgical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More good news: I will not have to see him or have another echo for six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told the doctor I have been feeling great since starting Camzyos. My metoprolol dose was increased last month, and I have been sleeping much better. He said everything seems to have calmed down, and my gradients with exertion have improved greatly. So, no immediate decisions need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also had a positive conversation with the cardiac interventionist and personally read my echo himself. It looked good, and he is pleased. I told him that I think staying consistent with my medication has helped. Lately, I have not had delays caused by the pharmacy needing certain tests before refilling my prescription, and I have not had any breaks where I was off the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means my main job now is simply dealing with the pharmacy and making sure I get my Camzyos on time each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's pray it keeps trending in the right direction. I actually feel normal for once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
