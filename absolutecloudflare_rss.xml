      <description xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">&lt;img alt=" Illustration of a man in a recliner reading a tablet; sunlit palm trees outside a large window, mini-split A/C on the wall, and an iced tea on a side table." src="https://michaels-journal.pages.dev/uploads/florida-ac-comfort-man-reading-recliner-flat-vector.png" width="600"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, especially in the heart of summer, I’ve been thinking about air conditioning and the inventions I’m most grateful for that have matured over my lifetime. I don’t think I could have lived in Florida back in the day without air conditioning. You really notice it when it’s gone. Last year, after Hurricane Milton, we lost power for four days. I couldn’t sleep, not only because the A/C was off but also because my CPAP had no power. That got me thinking about the top five inventions I’m grateful for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air conditioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Television&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick story about number five. My grandmother had a cabin in rural Florida with an outhouse until she brought in a trailer with an indoor bathroom. I hated having to go outside to that outhouse, especially at night. You never knew what might have made its way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these is pretty self-explanatory, but in Florida I’ve always said the state would be a ghost town without air conditioning. That’s why it’s number one.&lt;/p&gt;
