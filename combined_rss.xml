&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;An engineer lost in thought, surrounded by a maze of circuits and the glow of futuristic interfaces.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been swamped with projects and short on energy to tackle them, partly because of my worsening eyesight. I have glaucoma, but thankfully no loss of vision. My treatment includes twice-yearly eye pressure checks and nightly latanoprost. Even so, my glasses prescription seems to need constant updates, and I’ve always had a lot of floaters. My ophthalmologist reassures me that the floaters and eye pressure are fine, but my vision keeps changing, which is frustrating. After a recent visit to an optometrist for new glasses (an immediate improvement at first), I quickly found myself struggling again. It’s baffling how fast my eyesight shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ongoing vision issue is a big reason I’m putting off other projects. Other medical concerns, like my heart health, are actually improving. I have two SunFounder Pis to build, a few minor tasks, and I’m refining my blog and social-event posting software. I expect these projects to be fully functional soon, and I’ll update my blog as they progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having plenty to work on, my motivation is flagging.&lt;/p&gt;
